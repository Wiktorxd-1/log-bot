# Easy to use log bot

Special features that **most** log bots dont have:
- Thread logging
- Embed logging
- Logging messages by other bots

set-up:
/logging_channel {channel} set da logging channel
and uh thats all!
commands:
/log_del {log_message_id} delete a log from the logs (deleting manually will result in it being re-sent)

and thats pretty much all!
 
i reccomend just adding the public bot to your server ðŸ”— [Link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1418245833119236136&scope=bot&permissions=8)
